Be it the growing process of a plant from a seed or an airplane flying in the sky, I had a lot of questions in my mind. This curiosity led me to the world of Physics where I could get answers to a lot of doubts that I had during my childhood. I joined an undergraduate program in Physics and started to enjoy my studies, especially the practical lab sessions where I could learn the theories by experimenting and experiencing them.\n\n\nThat's when I started seriously encountering some data and numbers in my life. Even a minute mistake in the data collected during the experiments could get me a wrong result. This taught me the importance of clean and accurate data.\nDuring my summer vacations in college, I used to assist my cousin in his trading business. It patted my interest in marketing and business management. So I decided to do an MBA program after my undergraduate degree.\nFrom there onwards, I realized the importance of data in managing a business and in decision-making. For me, It was a day-to-day affair to deal with data to solve business problems and make better decisions backed by the available data. This continued throughout my career of more than 11 years, including 5 years of entrepreneurship and 2 years of business consulting.\n\n\nI am a person who understands the importance of continuous learning. I keep myself motivated to up-skill and widen my knowledge base regularly. During the covid-19 pandemic lockdown, I got more time to engage myself in learning. So, I decided to do a couple of online courses related to my career and personal interests. I strongly believe in making business decisions with the help of 'informed intuition'. So I decided to explore business analytics and the technical side of data science. After finishing those online courses, I strongly felt an urge to learn more about data analytics and data science.\n\n\nEven though there are plenty of online courses available, I believe that being in an environment of learning and surrounded by other great minds will motivate me to push myself to the limits. I started to research the on-campus programs in data analytics and data science. My search for a program that could take me to the next level in my career ended up in the Masters program of Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst. With the analytical skills and problem-solving abilities, state of the art data science technical skills and knowledge and the professional experience I have, I am confident that I am able to solve the real world data science problems and help help organizations make the best informed decisions.\n\n## **Technical Skills**\nMy technical skills include R programming language, Python, Web application development with Django, MS Office, Tableue, HTML & CSS.  \n\n\n## **My Interests**\nI love farming, road trips and travelling and music. Another thing I always love to do is working on new personal projects be it a web application or data science project or even some DIY art project."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","execution":{"freeze":"auto"},"mainfont":"Open Sans","linkcolor":"#881c1c","theme":{"light":["flatly","../styles.scss"],"dark":["darkly","../styles.scss"],"align":"center"},"comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"DACSS/DACSS_601_August2022_v2","category":"Blog"}},"toc-location":"right","search":true,"title":"Hi, I am Jerin Jacob","listing":{"type":"grid","contents":"about","fields":["image","title"],"sort":"title"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
