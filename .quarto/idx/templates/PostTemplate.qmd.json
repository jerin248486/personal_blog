Please observe the following conventions:\n\n-   Save your own copy of this template as a blog post in the `posts` folder.\n-   Edit the yaml header to change your author name\n-   include a *description* that is reader friendly\n-   update the *category* list to indicate what category is the blog post, the data used, the main packages or techniques, your name, or any thing else to make your document easy to find\n-   edit as a normal qmd/rmd file\n\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(2,3,4,5)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n## Rendering your post\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. \n\n:::{.callout-warning}\nBe sure that you have moved your `*.qmd` file into the `posts` folder **BEFORE** you render it, so that all files are stored in the correct location.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nOnly render a single file - don't try to render the whole website!\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Pilot Student Blogs\n\nWe are piloting a workflow including individual student websites with direted and limited pull requests back to course blogs. Please let us know if you would like to participate.\n:::\n\n## Reading in data files\n\nThe easiest data source to use - at least initially - is to choose something easily accessible, either from our `_data` folder provided, or from an online source that is publicly available.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Other Data\nIf you would like to use a source that you have access to and it is small enough and you don't mind making it public, you can copy it into the `_data` file and include in your *commit* and *pull request*.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Using Private Data\n\nIf you would like to use a proprietary source of data, that should be possible using the same process outlined above. There may initially be a few issues. We hope to have this feature working smoothly soon!\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"PostTemplate.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","execution":{"freeze":"auto"},"mainfont":"Open Sans","linkcolor":"#881c1c","theme":{"light":["flatly","../styles.scss"],"dark":["darkly","../styles.scss"]},"title":"Blog Post Template","author":"Your Name","desription":"Something to describe what I did","date":"08/02/2022","categories":["hw1","challenge1","my name","dataset","ggplot2"],"code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
